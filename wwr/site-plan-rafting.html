    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This site will be used to help first time pokemon card collectors obtain some information that will help them start on their journey. Pokemon card collecting has been going on for almost 30 years, releasing new sets bi-annually. As a result, it can be difficult to know where to begin. This website will offer a helping hand in knowing where to start.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The beginner pokemon collector, whether its a new fan to the franchise, a parent wanting to collect with their kid, or a person who has always wanted to, but is too imtimidated to start, this will be the website for them. I would like to make this wedbsite as easy as possible to navigate. I will seperate the website into different categories such as collections, common term and phrases used in the pokecard collecting hobby, and different ways to go about obtaining cards. I will try to use the bright and bold colors that they use in the pokemon franchise: Red, white,black, and yellow. The title itself should lead our audience here, and the simple navigation with helpful information will keep them here.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
