    <p>Hello Hello!</p>
    <p>My name is Sarah. I am currently pursuing a BS degree in software engineering. My goal is to work on the medical programs that I currently work with in my job as a chemotherapy scheduler</p>
    <p>I love to play. I play video games with my husband and our friends. I love to play my violin, which I have been playing for 17 years. Finally I love to play with my little siblings.</p>
    <p>As we have gone through the course, I have seen quite a few benefits to taking a web development class. The first is that it teaches a considerable ammount of programming, which I am in desperate need of since I have never done any sort of programming in my life. Second, it seems like it will be a great class to increase the creativity in our brains. Lastly, it will help increase our copacirty for organization, and catering to a public, not just ourselves.</p>
